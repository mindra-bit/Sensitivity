Sensitivity Analysis on Hyperprior Distribution of the Variance Components of Hierarchical Bayesian Spatiotemporal Disease Mapping 

Abstract: 
Spatiotemporal disease mapping modeling with computed data is gaining increasing prominence. 
This approach serves as a benchmark in developing early warning systems for diverse disease types. 
Spatiotemporal modeling, characterized by its inherent complexity, integrates spatial and temporal dependency structures, as well as interactions between space and time. 
A hierarchical Bayesian approach employing a hierarchical structure serves as a solution for spatial model inference, addressing the identifiability problem often encountered when utilizing classical approaches like the maximum likelihood method. 
However, the hierarchical Bayesian approach faces a significant challenge in determining the hyperprior distribution for the variance components of Bayesian Hierarchical Spatiotemporal models. 
Commonly used distributions include logGamma for log inverse variance, Half Cauchy, Penalized Complexity, and Uniform distribution for hyperparameter variance. 
While the LogGamma approach is relatively straightforward with faster computing times, it is highly sensitive to changes in hyperparameter values, specifically scale and shape. 
This research aims to identify the most optimal hyperprior distribution and parameters under various conditions of spatial and temporal autocorrelation, as well as observation units, through a Monte Carlo study. Real data on dengue cases in West Java are utilized alongside simulation results. 
The findings indicate that, across different conditions, the Uniform hyperprior distribution proves to be the most optimal choice.
